# solutionsprojecteuler
This is the repository for my solutions to almost all of the 100 first problems of projecteuler.net.
They are neither the fastest solutions nor the best implemented, just the solutions I’ve found while
learning C++ and hard mathematics with it. Plus, unfortunately, it is not documented or commented…
ask me if you want precisions :-)

# How-to build

Simply run the following commands:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    
The executable for each problem can then be found in the `<solutionsprojecteuler copy>/build/problems` directory.
